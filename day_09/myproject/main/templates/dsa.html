    <h1><u>DSA with Java</u></h1>
    <h3>
     DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) with Java focuses on learning <br>
      how to organize and store data efficiently and how to solve problems <br>
      using step-by-step procedures (algorithms) in the Java programming language. <br>
      It covers important data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, <br>
      trees, and graphs, along with algorithms for searching, sorting, and traversal. <br>
      Using Java helps implement these concepts with object-oriented programming features,<br>
       making it easier to write clean, reusable, and efficient code. Mastering DSA with Java <br>
       is crucial for developing optimized software and preparing for technical interviews.
