       Computer Organization refers to the operational <br>
       structure and functionality of a computer system's hardware <br>
       components. It deals with how different parts like the CPU,<br>
        memory, input/output devices, and buses work together to execute <br>
        instructions. Understanding computer organization helps in grasping <br>
         how software interacts with hardware, including concepts like instruction <br>
          cycles, data flow, and control signals. It forms the foundation for <br>
           designing efficient and optimized computer systems.
